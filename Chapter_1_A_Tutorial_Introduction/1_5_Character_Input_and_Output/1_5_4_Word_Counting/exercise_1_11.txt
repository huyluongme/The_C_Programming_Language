Exercise 1-11. How would you test the word count program? What kinds of input are most likely to uncover bugs if there are any?

Answer: To test the word count program, I would use a variety of input cases, especially boundary and unusual cases.
These include empty input, input containing only blanks, tabs or newlines, input with multiple consecutive spaces, tabs and newlines between words, input with leading and trailing whitespace, and input with a single word or a single character.
I would also test normal text with words separated by spaces, tabs, and newlines to ensure the program correctly counts words.
These cases are most likely to reveal bugs related to word boundaries and state transitions between inside and outside a word.
